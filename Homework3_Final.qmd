## Load the necessary data, tables, and packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)
library(GGally)
library(MuMIn)
library(ggeffects)
library(knitr)

# Read in the excel fike
drought_exp <- read_xlsx(path = "/Users/masonbuczek/Envs-193DS/Homework_3/Valliere_etal_EcoApps_Data.xlsx",
                         sheet = "First Harvest")
```

## Preliminary Data Cleaning

```{r}
# Cleaning the Data
drought_exp_clean <- drought_exp %>% 
  clean_names() %>% # nicer column names
  mutate(species_name = case_when( # Create new column with scientific names
    species == "ENCCAL" ~ "Encelia californica", # bush sunflower
    species == "ESCCAL" ~ "Eschscholzia californica", # California poppy
    species == "PENCEN" ~ "Penstemon centranthifolius", # Scarlet bugler
    species == "GRICAM" ~ "Grindelia camporum", # great valley gumweed
    species == "SALLEU" ~ "Salvia leucophylla", # Purple sage
    species == "STIPUL" ~ "Nasella pulchra", # Purple needlegrass
    species == "LOTSCO" ~ "Acmispon glaber" # deerweed
  )) %>% 
  relocate(species_name, .after = species) %>% # Move species_name column after species
  mutate(water_treatment = case_when( # adding column with full treatment names
    water == "WW" ~ "Well watered",
    water == "DS" ~ "Drought stressed"
  )) %>% 
  relocate(water_treatment, .after = water) # Move water_treatment column after water

# Model Construction

# Model 0: Null model
model0 <- lm(total_g ~ 1, # formula
             data = drought_exp_clean) # data frame

# Model 1: Saturated Model
model1 <- lm(total_g ~ sla + water_treatment + species_name,
             data = drought_exp_clean)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))

# Model 2: Model total biomass as a function of SLA and water treatment
model2 <- lm(total_g ~ sla + water_treatment,
             data = drought_exp_clean)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))

# Model 3: Model total biomass as a function of SLA and species
model3 <- lm(total_g ~ sla + species_name,
             data = drought_exp_clean)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))

#Model 4: (My own model) Model total biomass as a function of water treatment only
model4 <- lm(total_g ~ water_treatment,
             data = drought_exp_clean)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
